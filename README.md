# KProcessModel (KPM)

This repository contains the notebook used to create and implement KPM. 

The API folder contains the KPM algorithm and can be imported as a package into a python notebook (see the example file). This program is still under development!

In the `Notebooks` folder, `KPM_old.ipynb` is a deprecated version of the KPM code, but contains some commit history. `KPM.ipynb` is the final version of the code used in Griffith et al. (2023b). 

The `Paper` folder contains the latex files and figures needed to reproduce our article Griffith et al. (2023b), found here: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230705691G/abstract.

The `Tables` folder contains fits files of the tables found in Griffith et al. (2023b).
