# KProcessModel (KPM)

This repository contains the code and example notebooks used to implement the K Process Model. 

The `API` folder contains the KPM algorithm and can be imported as a package into a Python notebook (see the example file). This program is still under development!

In the `2024_KPM_paper` folder, `Notebooks/KPM_old.ipynb` is a deprecated version of the KPM code, but contains some commit history. `KPM.ipynb` is the final version of the code used in Griffith et al. (2024a). This folder contains the LaTex files and figures from Griffith et al. (2024a) as well as the tables of fit parameters from that paper.
